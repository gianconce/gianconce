**Hello :) I'm Gianmarco**

Software engineer with interest in design, minimalism & cryptocurrencies. 


What I'm doing now: 

- Searching for a new remote position as a software engineer
- Looking to collaborate on an open-source project - know a good one?
- Spending 1/3 of my days writing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript 
- Getting better at Bootstrap and React

*Quick note: Deleted all of my repositories because I want to start from scratch (I'm so much better at coding now).
